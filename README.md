# Vital Chain

**Vital Chain** is a **Flutter mobile application** designed to **consolidate and manage a patient's complete medical health records in one place**. It addresses the critical issue of **fragmented health data** by bringing together all documents, prescriptions, certificates, and chronic disease records into a single, accessible platform. The app also **eliminates the dependency on handwritten paper prescriptions** by automatically generating and storing digital PDF prescriptions issued by doctors.

By providing real-time access to a patient‚Äôs **allergies, medical history , ongoing medications , prescreptions , lab results and certificates**, Vital Chain ensures that doctors can make more informed decisions, leading to **safer and more effective treatment**. With features tailored for both **patients** and **doctors**, Vital Chain creates a seamless, secure, and centralized healthcare experience.
